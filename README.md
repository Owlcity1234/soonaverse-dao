# About
The Soonaverse is a decentralized platform for communities, enabling the seamless creation, management, and interoperability of DAOs.

DAO-on-Demand (DoD) enables the “one-click” setup of DAOs and provides components that simplify complex DAO operations through an integrated set of feeless core modules. This includes the Secure Feeless Voting module, the first feeless, on-chain voting system in the industry. The Soonaverse also includes 2 innovative and feature-enhancing service modules; the Token LaunchPad and the Reputation Station.

## Modules:

***Currently Implemented***
- DAO on Demand
